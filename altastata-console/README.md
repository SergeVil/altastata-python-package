# altastata-console

Web console for [AltaStata](https://altastata.com) — a Finder-style file browser
for cloud accounts, modeled after the JavaFX desktop app
(`mycloud/altastata-ui`).

This repo is a React client for AltaStata Java gRPC (`mycloud/altastata-grpc`)
and follows the same RPC flows as `altastata-python-package/tests/js-grpc-ui`.

## Architecture

```

For local development, Vite serves the frontend and calls Java gRPC directly.

## Quick start (development)

Prereqs: Node 20+, Java 17+.
Ensure AltaStata gRPC server is available on `127.0.0.1:9877`
(same as `altastata-python-package/tests/js-grpc-ui`).

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # → http://localhost:5173
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

Open the top-right settings button in the app and provide runtime values:

- gRPC base URL
- account ID
- user name
- user properties
- private key
- password

Then use **Save & Run Bootstrap** to run:

1. `SetUserProperties`
2. `SetPrivateKey`
3. `SetPasswordForUser`

This is now the preferred flow for local development.

The Settings dialog header also shows the bundle's build version and ISO
timestamp (baked in at build time via Vite `define`) so it is unambiguous
which dist the browser is serving — handy when chasing cache-busting issues.

### Live updates (events)

While the UI is open it keeps a long-running gRPC server-streaming call to
`altastata.v1.EventsService/Watch`. The Java backend forwards
`SecureCloudEventProcessor` notifications as typed `Event` payloads
(`FileSharedEvent` when another user shares a file with the current user,
`FileUnsharedEvent` when access is revoked or a shared file is deleted) and
the UI auto-refreshes the current view so the file list never goes stale.
The stream auto-reconnects on transient failures with the last seen
`since_sequence` to replay any missed events from the per-user ring buffer,
and a follow-up refresh is scheduled ~7s after every event to absorb the
gap between the event dispatch and the backend's "Finishing shot"
finalisation.

### UI log panel

The terminal icon next to the settings button opens a "UI log" dialog
showing recent `console.*` output captured by an in-app ring buffer
(`frontend/src/utils/logBuffer.ts`). It's intended for debugging gRPC /
auth issues without forcing the user to open browser DevTools, and shows
the same lines that appear in the real console.

### Generate keys (GenerateKeys)

The **key** icon in the top bar opens **Generate keys**:

1. Pick key type (RSA, PQC, or HPCS (RSA)). HPCS requires GREP11 on the gateway (`GREP11_YAML` / populated `grep11client.yaml`).
2. Optional folder name (e.g. `rsa.myuser`) and password (RSA/PQC only).
3. **Generate keys** → **Download zip** (`<folder>.altastata.zip`).
4. Unpack under `~/.altastata/accounts/`, send `public.key` to your org admin, save
   the returned `*user.properties` into the same folder, then **Settings → Sign in**.

Requires a gateway with `AccountSetupService.GenerateKeys` (local dev:
`altastata-services` on port **9880**, not the older Docker image on 9877).

You can still prefill defaults via `frontend/.env.local` (safe placeholders only):

```bash
VITE_ALTASTATA_GRPC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9877
VITE_ALTASTATA_ACCOUNT_ID=amazon.rsa.<user>
VITE_ALTASTATA_GRPC_USER_NAME=<user>
# Password is entered manually in Settings each session.
# Sign in: choose account folder (*user.properties + private keys) → LoginV2 upload.
VITE_ALTASTATA_AUTO_BOOTSTRAP=true
```

## Secrets policy

- Never commit real account key files or `password`.
- Account material (`*user.properties`, private keys) is held in memory only — not localStorage.
- `password` is not persisted to browser localStorage by the app.
- Keep sensitive values in local runtime settings and/or local `.env.local`.
- `.env.local` is gitignored in this repo, but always verify with `git status` before committing.
- If a secret is accidentally committed, rotate it immediately.

### Optional pre-commit secret guard

This repo includes `scripts/prevent-secrets-commit.sh` to block common mistakes
before commit.

Enable it locally:

```bash
cd /path/to/altastata-console
ln -sf ../../scripts/prevent-secrets-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

What it blocks:

- staging `.env`-style files and common key files (`.pem`, `private.key`)
- staged diff lines that look like private keys or password fields

Intentional override (rare):

```bash
ALLOW_SECRETS_COMMIT=1 git commit -m "..."
```

## Production build

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build   # → frontend/dist/
```

`frontend/dist/` is the only artifact this repo produces. It is a
static SPA that talks to `altastata-grpc` directly via gRPC-Web; no
Python, FastAPI, or Node runtime is required at runtime.

### Distribution

The bundle ships inside the [`altastata` Python package][pyalt] under
`altastata/lib/altastata-console-static/`. Any image that already
includes `altastata` therefore already includes the UI, and the Java
gRPC server (`mycloud/altastata-grpc`) serves those static files
directly on `:9877` — no separate web container is needed.

[pyalt]: https://github.com/SergeVil/altastata-python-package

The bundle is **not committed** to the Python package repo
(`altastata/lib/` is gitignored, same policy as
`altastata-grpc-*-uber.jar`). It is rebuilt locally before each
release by
[`altastata-python-package/scripts/build-bundled-artifacts.sh`][buildscript],
which runs `npm run build` here, then copies `frontend/dist/` into
`altastata-python-package/altastata/lib/altastata-console-static/`.

[buildscript]: https://github.com/SergeVil/altastata-python-package/blob/openshift/scripts/build-bundled-artifacts.sh

There is no Docker step in this repo.

## Why a separate repo?

- `altastata` (Python package) is a library imported by data-science code.
  Its consumers don't want a node toolchain pulled in via `pip install`.
- Console release cadence is independent (UI fixes ship more often than
  library API changes).
- Mirrors the pattern already established in `mycloud/`:
  `altastata-admin-ui` / `altastata-admin-api` are similarly split.

## Reference UI

The visual target is `mycloud/altastata-ui` (JavaFX desktop, "AltaStata
Cloud File Explorer" v1.0.6) — three columns (folders → files → preview),
account name in the title bar, action toolbar at the bottom, light theme.
See `docs/architecture.md` for screenshots and mapping to web components.

## License

TBD — copy from `altastata` repo when finalizing.
